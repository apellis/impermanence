# Impermanence app privacy policy

This app does not collect or transmit any user data. It does not use third-party analytics, tracking pixels, or advertising SDKs. The app stores user settings on-device. This data includes but is not limited to: names and durations of user-configured timers and user preferences such as 12- vs. 24-hour time format.

While the app does not collect any data, the operating system (iOS or Android) may collect standard usage telemetry (e.g. crash reports) governed by your own settings with Apple or Google. Impermanence does not access or process this data.

This software is published in the United States. By using it, you agree that it is governed solely by US law. We reject the extraterritorial application of foreign data laws (such as GDPR) because we have rendered them irrelevant through data abstinence.
