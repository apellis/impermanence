# Impermanence

A timer for meditation retreats. Open source and freely available on the iOS App Store.

## iOS

### Status

* Version 1.2 available [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/impermanence/id6462615517)

### TODO

* Better editing functionality, e.g. "clone day" or "clone segment"
* Color theming for segments
* More accessibility hints
* Add contextual help in editing UI
* 12- vs. 24-hour time setting
* Setting to enable/disable looping at midnight (currently does)
* Non-timed notes visible in agenda view
* Customizable bells (sound, number of rings)
* "Quick sit" feature
* Manual bell ring from active day UI

## Android

### Status

* Version 1.0 available [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ape.meditationretreattimer&hl=en&gl=US), under the older name "Meditation Retreat Timer"
* Deprecated and ugly
* I hope to rewrite this some day, mimicking the current iOS version
